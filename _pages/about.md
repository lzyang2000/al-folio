Hello there! My name is Lizhi Yang. I am currently a Mechanical Engineering PhD candidate at Caltech. My research interests are in **legged robotics**, **control** and **machine learning**. Apart from my research, I am engaged in STEM outreach, and was involved in groups such as [Pioneers in Engineering](https://pioneers.berkeley.edu/). I have also worked at Samsara Inc. In life I am a tech enthusiast and sci-fi lover. If you are interested in talking with me, please feel free to contact me at the email at the bottom of the page!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
